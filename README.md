# Some Infos
Hello and welcome to my GitHub profile! As you can probably see, I don't have any public repo, and I want to express just some thoughts about this since I often think about "showcasing" and all that stuff:
- There's so much stuff already: a large quantity of problems have been tackled, and you can find so many software solutions for your needs
- I write stuff to play with some concepts, and (until now) I can't think of something that I produced worth noting
- The majority of my work is related to company-internal stuff, as I'm a professional software engineer working for a private company (I develop avionics display software)
- I'm a professional overthinker, and as soon as I finish something, I find it poorly executed, and I'm ashamed to show it
