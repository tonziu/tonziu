ğŸ‘‹ Hello everyone! I'm @tonziu and I'm a Master's degree student in Electronics Engineering based in Benevento (IT).

ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m currently interested in software development in C#, but that changes pretty quickly as I get involved in different things!

ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to design my server indipendent apps to build useful solutions that I can personally use.
